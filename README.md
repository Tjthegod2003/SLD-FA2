You must create an Azure account and an Azure Blob Storage account using the Azure Portal in order to utilize the given C# application. After creating a storage account, go to the Azure Portal's "Access keys" area and get the account connection string. Put your connection string in lieu of the connectionString variable in the code. In order to specify the name of your Azure Blob Storage container, you should also alter the containerName variable. Make sure you use NuGet to install the Azure.Storage.Blobs package before launching the application (dotnet add package Azure.Storage.Blobs).
After completing the necessary setup, you can use your choice C# programming environment to compile and run the program. If the designated blob container does not already exist, the program will build it, upload a local file as a blob, list all of the blobs in the container, download the given blob from the container, and delete the specified blob from the container. To define the file you wish to upload, edit the local file path in the localFilePath variable. You can also make necessary adjustments to the blob name. The application manages faults and shows you its activities through console output.
